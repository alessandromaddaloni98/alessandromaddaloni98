Hi, I'm Alessandro Maddaloni — passionate about AI, machine learning, and the real-world impact of data-driven technologies.

I hold a Master's in Economics & Business, currently pursuing a second Master's in Data Science, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, and advanced analytics — with a strong interest in artificial neural networks and their practical applications.

I enjoy working on projects where data meets innovation, especially in fields like business strategy and industrial automation.

Curious, driven, and multidisciplinary — always looking to learn, build, and contribute.
